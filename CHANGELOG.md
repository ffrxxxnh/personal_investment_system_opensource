## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Docker One-Click Deployment**: Zero-friction setup for non-technical users
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile with optimized image size (~500MB)
  - `docker-compose.yml` for single-command deployment
  - `docker-entrypoint.sh` with auto-initialization and first-run detection
  - Environment variable configuration (SECRET_KEY, FLASK_HOST, FLASK_PORT, etc.)
  - Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/api/health`) for container orchestration
  - `DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md` with usage instructions
  - Development plan documentation in `docs/docker-deployment/`

- **Internationalization (I18n)**: Implemented full localization support using Flask-Babel.
  - Added language switcher (English/Chinese) in navigation bar.
  - Localized "Portfolio Report" template and key backend report builders.
  - Implemented locale-aware configuration loading (e.g., `asset_taxonomy_zh.yaml`).
  - Added `scripts/extract_messages.py` for managing translation workflows.
  - Added Chinese translations for key terms.
  - **Phase 8**: Localized Data Workbench template (~45 strings).
  - **Phase 8**: Localized Logic Studio template (~80+ strings).
  - **Phase 8**: Message catalog now contains 300+ translation entries.

### Fixed

- **Portfolio Report 500 Error**: Resolved a template rendering error caused by `%` characters in translation strings (`XIRR (%)`, `Portfolio Growth (%)`). Moved the `(%)` suffix outside of `_()` translation calls.
- **Report Cache Serialization**: Fixed `Object of type Timestamp is not JSON serializable` error by extending `NumpyEncoder` to handle `pandas.Timestamp` and `datetime` objects.
- **Recommendation Engine Robustness**: Added defensive check for `XIRR` column in `_generate_profit_rebalancing_recommendation` to prevent `KeyError` when the column is missing.

- `CLAUDE.md` - Consolidated AI coding assistant guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history for open source users
- `config/column_mapping.yaml` - Configurable column mappings for data ingestion
- `scripts/generate_demo_data.py` - Generate mock financial data for testing
- Environment-based web authentication (WEB_ADMIN_USER, WEB_ADMIN_PASS)
- Support for multiple mapping profiles (default, schwab_csv, chinese_excel)
- Quick Start guide in README for demo data
- New ETFs in demo data: VEA (Developed Markets), IEMG (Emerging Markets), VNQ (Real Estate)

### Changed

- **Flask App Docker Compatibility**:
  - `run-web` command now accepts `--host` parameter for Docker binding
  - SECRET_KEY configurable via environment variable (auto-generated if not set)
  - Environment variable fallbacks for FLASK_HOST, FLASK_PORT, FLASK_DEBUG
- **Demo Data Generator Overhaul**: Complete rewrite for chart compatibility and global appeal
  - Balance sheet columns now use `Asset_*`/`Liability_*` prefixes for calculator compatibility
  - Cash flow columns now use `Income_*`/`Expense_*`/`Outflow_Invest_*` prefixes
  - Expanded from 7 to 10 US ETFs (added VEA, IEMG, VNQ for diversification)
  - Scaled all values to USD (~$300K portfolio, $8K/month income)
  - Gold and insurance data now in USD
- **Terminology Refactor**: Replaced "CN Funds" with "Global Markets" across CLI, logs, and documentation for professional consistency
- **Docs Cleanup**: Consolidated documentation in `docs/` folder, removing legacy development logs
- Data ingestion now uses YAML-based column mappings instead of hardcoded dictionaries
- Web app now requires password via environment variable (no hardcoded default)
- `cleaners.py` refactored with proper logging and fallback mechanism
- Column mappings use lazy loading to avoid circular imports

### Removed

- `gemini.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (replaced by CLAUDE.md)
- `config/rsu_schedule.yaml` from git tracking (now gitignored, use template)
- Hardcoded column mapping dictionaries from cleaners.py (~200 lines)
- CN Fund data generator and CN_FUNDS dictionary (replaced with global ETFs)
