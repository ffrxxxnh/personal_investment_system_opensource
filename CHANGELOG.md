## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **Docker One-Click Deployment**: Zero-friction setup for non-technical users
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile with optimized image size (~500MB)
  - `docker-compose.yml` for single-command deployment
  - `docker-entrypoint.sh` with auto-initialization and first-run detection
  - Environment variable configuration (SECRET_KEY, FLASK_HOST, FLASK_PORT, etc.)
  - Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/api/health`) for container orchestration
  - `DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md` with usage instructions
  - Development plan documentation in `docs/docker-deployment/`

    - `SystemStateManager` class for detecting system state
    - Context processor for template access (`system_state`, `is_demo_mode`, `is_first_run`)
    - First-run redirect middleware
  - **Phase 3-4**: Onboarding flow for first-run experience
    - Welcome page with Demo/Upload/Skip options
    - Drag-and-drop file upload interface
    - Column mapping for CSV/Excel imports
    - CSV templates for transactions, holdings, and balance sheet
  - **Phase 5**: Data import engine (`src/data_import/csv_importer.py`)
  - **Phase 8**: Verification & Fixes
    - Fixed first-run redirect logic to prioritize onboarding
    - Implemented auto-login for Demo Mode
    - Resolved system state detection conflict in entrypoint script
    - Auto-detection of encoding and delimiter
    - Flexible column mapping with auto-detection
    - Data validation and error reporting
  - **Phase 6**: UX polish
    - Demo mode banner with dismiss functionality
    - Custom 404 and 500 error pages
  - **Phase 7**: Documentation (`docs/csv-formats.md`)

- **Internationalization (I18n)**: Implemented full localization support using Flask-Babel.
  - Added language switcher (English/Chinese) in navigation bar.
  - Localized "Portfolio Report" template and key backend report builders.
  - Implemented locale-aware configuration loading (e.g., `asset_taxonomy_zh.yaml`).
  - Added `scripts/extract_messages.py` for managing translation workflows.
