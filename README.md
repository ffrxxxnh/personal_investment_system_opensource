## 🚀 Why This Project?

Traditional finance tools force a tradeoff: surrender your privacy to cloud apps, or suffer in spreadsheet hell. **Personal Investment System** breaks this dichotomy. It is an open-source, locally-run engine designed for the **Vibe Coding** era—where logic is transparent, data is yours, and analysis is professional-grade.

### Core Pillars

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 AI-Driven Logic** | Built for **Vibe Coding**. The codebase is modular, typed, and documented to be easily read and modified by LLMs. Logic is transparent—no black boxes. |
| **🔒 Privacy First** | **Local Execution.** Your financial data never leaves your machine. No cloud sync, no tracking, no third-party APIs unless you configure them. |
| **📊 Sophisticated Analysis** | **Wall Street Grade.** Native support for Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Market Thermometers, and Hierarchical Asset Classification. |
